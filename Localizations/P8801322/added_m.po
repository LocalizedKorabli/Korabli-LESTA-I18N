"A battleship built at the Baltic Shipyard and launched in June 1911 under the name 'Sevastopol', it became the first dreadnought of the Imperial Navy. It participated in World War I and the Civil War.\n"
"\n"
"In March 1921, the ship was renamed 'Paris Commune'. In 1921–24, the battleship was repaired and subsequently entered active service in the Baltic Fleet. In 1929, as part of modernization, a bow extension was installed to improve its seakeeping and speed. Later that year, 'Paris Commune' was transferred to the Black Sea. In 1930–36, in Sevastopol, the battleship underwent extensive modernization with boiler replacement and upgrades to its anti-aircraft armament.\n"
"\n"
"During the Great Patriotic War, the ship participated in the defense of Odessa and Sevastopol. 'Paris Commune' supported the operations of the Crimea Front and the Feodosia landing."
