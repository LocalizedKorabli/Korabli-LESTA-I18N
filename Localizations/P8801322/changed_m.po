msgstr ""
"In 1932, amid the Great Depression, store owners in Mesa, Arizona, faced hard times. With the annual Christmas parade approaching, local entrepreneurs sought a way to draw visitors to the event—and consequently, to the stores along its route.\n"
"\n"
"John McAfee, an editor at a local newspaper, proposed an unusual idea: hire a parachutist dressed as Santa Claus to jump from an airplane and land in a field outside town, after which the police would escort him to the parade to distribute gifts.\n"
"\n"
"The plan hit its first snag when the hired parachutist was unable to jump on the day of the parade. Undeterred, the resourceful McAfee borrowed a mannequin from one of the stores, dressed it in a Santa costume, and placed it on the airplane instead. Believing that no one would notice the substitution from afar since Santa was meant to land outside town, McAfee proceeded. When the airplane reached sufficient altitude, the mannequin was pushed out by pulling the parachute cord. At that critical moment, the parachute failed to deploy, and 'Santa' crashed to the ground like a stone before the eyes of gathered children.\n"
"\n"
"McAfee then attempted to salvage the holiday by donning a Santa costume himself and approaching the children to calm them down. However, the children were inconsolable, convinced that Santa had just perished in a crash. McAfee even left town for several days, hoping that time would mend the situation. Nevertheless, the incident was not forgotten, and henceforth John McAfee became known as 'the man who killed Santa Claus.'"

"In 1997, Lori Stack, the manager of the 'Naglis' store, discovered a box of kittens in the parking lot. She chose Stabbes because he had no tail. The kitten soon settled into the store, and word of him spread throughout the small town.\n"
"\n"
"Legend has it that Stabbes became mayor after some voters wrote his name on the ballots during an election. Skeptics dispute this version, noting that Talkeetna, being a small settlement, does not officially have a mayor. The 'Naglis' store served as the cat’s office throughout his term. Every day, Stabbes would visit a nearby restaurant where he sipped water with catnip from a wine glass."

"In the late 1920s, as Germany reflected on its experiences during World War I, the concept of a large surface raider emerged. Several designs were developed for such a ship, taking into account Britain’s desire at future naval conferences to limit battleship armament to a 305mm caliber.\n"
"\n"
"Depending on the design, the ship’s standard displacement ranged from 17,500 to 25,000 tons, and its armament typically consisted of eight 305mm guns in four turrets along with a robust secondary battery of 150mm guns. The armor and anti-torpedo protection were considered too light for the vessel to be classified as a true battleship."
