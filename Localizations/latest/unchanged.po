"At the end of 1943, the German Army suffered defeat after defeat on the Eastern Front. The Allies resumed escorting convoys in the Arctic to deliver equipment and armaments to the Red Army. All large ships of the Kriegsmarine gathered in Norway to prevent this. The British forces, with the assistance of the Norwegian resistance, were closely monitoring their location and movements, grasping every opportunity to incapacitate the enemy ships. In December 1943, only battleship Scharnhorst and a couple of destroyers remained combat-ready in Norway. To lure the armored beast from its lair, the Allies sent another convoy, JW-55B, on a course dangerously close to the Norwegian coast. A few hours from the convoy, the Distant Cover Force, headed by Duke of York, the flagship of the Home Fleet's Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Fraser, was steaming ahead, under the cover of a storm.\n"

The conflict was among the bloodiest in human history, with more than 1,000,000 people wounded or killed during the battle. Nearly 30 years later, several British Battle-class destroyers were named in commemoration of the Battle of the Somme and other significant encounters of World War I in which the British Army and Navy were involved.

msgstr ""
"Under \"Z-Plan\", which was adopted in 1939, Germany sought to build an ocean-going fleet by 1946 that could challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The plan called for a fleet centered on six H-39 battleships with 406 mm main guns and a displacement of 53,000 tons. In the spring of 1939, two battleships were laid down and the remaining ships were ordered. Work on the ships was then halted due to the outbreak of World War II, but the design process continued, and the designers made alterations in response to the changing war conditions.\n"
"\n"
"The Germans received intelligence reports that the new British Lion-class battleships, which had been under construction since 1939, were equipped with 406 mm guns. In response to this, in 1942 the Kriegsmarine's Construction Office completed work on the H-41 design with a 420 mm main battery, reinforced armor, and a displacement of 64,000 tons. Because of its solid draft, such a warship could no longer be deployed in the shallow waters of the North and the Baltic Seas, but this didn't stop the Germans—they had already conquered the Atlantic coast of France and Norway. Three H-41 battleships were to be laid down 6 to 9 months after victory on the eastern front. The estimated construction time was five years.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, the Reich's High Command requested a larger battleship with no restrictions on its gun caliber or displacement. The Kriegsmarine didn't see any practical need for it but another ministry stepped in—the Ministry for Armaments and Munitions. Reichsminister Speer established the New Ships Construction Commission (Schiffsneubaukommission), a body that was totally independent of the German navy. Between 1942 and 1945, the commission worked out three battleship designs.\n"
"\n"
"The first design, of the H-42 type, was to carry eight 483 mm guns placed in four twin-gun turrets and reach a speed of 31 knots with a displacement of 90,000 tons. However, there were no slipways large enough to build a ship of that size in Germany, nor anywhere across occupied Europe.\n"
"\n"
"Yet the subsequent projects, H-43 and H-44, turned out to be even more colossal. The Construction Office of the Kriegsmarine didn't seriously consider any of the designs elaborated by Speer's Schiffsneubaukommission, and sought to disassociate itself from them. None of the battleships ever made it past the design stage. As a result, it's no surprise that the Third Reich navy documents that ended up in the hands of the Allied intelligence services after the war contain incomplete information about these ships."

msgstr ""
"Between 1930 and 1940, the Imperial Japanese Navy consistently pursued a series of Naval Armaments Supplement Programs. One of these programs, dated 1941, provided for the construction of super battleships with 510 mm guns. The decision to arm them as such was made when a piece of misleading intelligence information came in with a statement made by the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy to the press that the Montana-class battleships ordered in 1940 would carry a 457 mm main battery and run at 33 knots. Had that statement been true, those ships would have outmatched the Japanese Yamato-class battleships that were at the core of the Japanese plans to secure a qualitative advantage over the U.S. Navy.\n"
"\n"
"The project for a new super battleship was indexed \"A-150\". The first design called for eight 510 mm guns placed in four twin turrets and a displacement of 85,000 tons. Compared with Yamato, the medium caliber also grew from 155 to 203 mm, while the 127 mm AA guns were replaced with the latest 100 mm cannons. But the project turned out to be so enormous and expensive that the Japanese ultimately decided to retrofit Yamato instead. This would save them time as well because replacing 460 mm triple turrets with 510 mm twin turrets under an already existing project required much less effort than working out a new one from scratch.\n"
"\n"
"The second design for an A-150 super battleship was to have a displacement of approximately 70,000 tons; run at 27 knots; and carry six 510 mm main guns plus an AA battery comprising 100 mm guns. No medium caliber guns were to be mounted. One ship was to have been laid down in Yokosuka following the launch of Shinano, and another one in Kure after a fourth Yamato-class battleship had been launched. The ships were to be commissioned between 1946 and 1947, but Project A-150 was destined not to be enshrined in metal and has only remained on paper. As the prospect of war had become increasingly likely by November 1941, the construction of all Japanese battleships was suspended. Permanently, as it turned out.\n"
"\n"
"American intelligence was quite unaware of the work on those projects. Due to the extreme secrecy maintained by Japan in naval construction, the United States didn't even know the main battery caliber of battleships Yamato and Musashi, which were both in service, until the end of the war. They believed that both ships carried only 406 mm guns. Any encounter at sea between U.S. battleships and these Japanese warships would have entailed dire consequences.\n"
"\n"
"After their surrender, the Japanese elaborately destroyed most of the evidence of the A-150 battleship design. For this reason, we have very little information about the last super battleship from the Land of the Rising Sun, and what we do have is extremely contradictory."

msgstr "The U.S. Navy High Command conceived that \"fleet submarines\" were to complement the sluggish conventional battleships. With a high surface speed, heavy armament, and long operational range, they were supposed to conduct reconnaissance and finish off enemy ships once artillery duels between battleships ceased. However, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, their strategy changed, and a new type—Gato—was geared for extended patrols. Comfortable for their crews, these submarines carried a large fuel supply and torpedoes. USS Gato was laid down in October 1940 and commissioned in December 1941. The submarine conducted thirteen combat missions, earning the same number of battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation."

In late 1942, work on Project X1 commenced—a ship with a displacement of 56,800 tons. The main disputes arose around the hangar, as previous ships were built with an entirely closed hangar. However, the U.S. aircraft carriers' operating experience showed that it's necessary to warm up aircraft engines in the hangar to carry out a massive launch of the air group. The choice fell on a project with an open hangar and two aircraft lifts on the port side. All works were stopped with the end of World War II."

"At all times, the image of a ship had an aesthetic value to it that is incomparable to any other man-made creation. The immense, mysterious, and even charming presence of majestic sailing ships has fascinated people for centuries. Then came the 19th century—a new era of engineering and automation known as the Industrial Revolution that spurred the development of human technology onwards at an unprecedented rate. Graceful carved wood and woven cloth functioning in harmony with nature's breath were replaced at sea by metal and billowing steam.\n"

The 20th century brought with it unprecedented and ruthless world wars, and it was only natural that warships took center stage in shipbuilding at the time. Yet, people never ceased to admire the regularity and symmetry of their features, the complexity and deadly power of the weapons they carried."

The future naval commander, who became famous after taking the Yamamoto surname, was a self-disciplined man with a warrior's spirit, and these characteristics were nurtured during his time at the Imperial Naval Academy in Etajima. The Battle of Tsushima, a decisive naval fight against the Russian Empire in May 1905, was the first combat outing of this officer, and the first in which he displayed his fortitude in battle. Cruiser Nisshin, with Isoroku on board, spent many hours confronting the battleships and cruisers of one of the major powers together with the Japanese battleship and cruiser forces, and suffered significant damage during the course of battle. Fragments of an exploded main turret seriously wounded Takano Isoroku, but he stayed at his post until the combat ended. The courage of the young officer was noticed by Admiral Tōgō, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet."

He took a training course in the Artillery School and then entered the Naval War College. He was adopted into the Yamamoto family, took their name and became the heir to the well known and influential clan. Through his interest in warfare innovations, studying the latest technical novelties during business trips abroad, and working as the representative of the Japanese Navy in the U.S.A., Yamamoto realized that the future of naval warfare belonged to carrier-based aircraft. He was appointed a head of the first Japanese naval aviation school where new aircraft for the Navy were tested."

Due to his extensive knowledge, he participated as Rear and Vice Admiral in two international naval conferences to protect the interests of his country. For a while, Yamamoto commanded the First Carrier Division, then, for a few years, he managed key units of the Navy Ministry, which were responsible for carrier-based aircraft development, and initiated the development of several promising aircraft models. In 1939, Yamamoto left his post of Deputy Navy Minister to become Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, the largest naval force of Japan. Though he was against the aggressive intentions of the Army command, which gained a major influence in the country, the Admiral had to prepare the fleet for its upcoming confrontation with the U.S.A. on the Pacific Ocean. Under his command, a famous tactic of the Japanese Navy was honed: attack the enemy at night using the firepower of cruiser squadrons and destroyer-launched torpedoes."

msgstr "After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto commanded a series of brilliant naval operations and took control of vast territories in the Pacific region. He provided guidance from the most massive Japanese battleships: Nagato, Yamato, and Musashi. His thoroughly planned landing operations included victorious naval battles, in which the forces of the U.S.A., U.K., Australia, and Netherlands were utterly smashed. Progressive tactics and effective use of torpedoes were the strengths of Yamamoto's fleet. Cruiser divisions and destroyer flotillas paved the way, aircraft carriers were the main striking force, and battleships waited for a general engagement. However, Yamamoto's concerns that people, warship, and aircraft losses after a confrontation with the U.S.A. couldn't be compensated, had been justified. The victories were followed by defeats: Midway, Guadalcanal, and many others. In April 1943, Admiral Yamamoto was inspecting the key points on the long frontline. U.S.A. surveillance deciphered information about the flights of the Commander-in-Chief. They organized an extensive operation to intercept the aircraft with Yamamoto on board and managed to shoot it down over the jungles of an island in the Pacific Ocean. The prominent Admiral died clutching his samurai sword."

"William Frederick Halsey Jr. was a natural-born seaman. He was born in the small port town of Elizabeth, New Jersey, to the family of naval officer. The future Admiral's ancestry included many pirates and whalers, so he was destined to spend his life at sea. In 1899, after failing to obtain a long-awaited appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Halsey Jr. entered the University of Virginia with the single purpose to join the Navy, even as a physician. The only great thing he acquired at university was his passion for American football.\n"
"\n"
"When Halsey eventually joined the Naval Academy in 1900, little did they know they had opened its doors to one of its most famous graduates. However, capricious and stubborn \"Pudge\" Halsey was not the sharpest tool in the shed. As far as his academic performance was concerned, he ranked 42nd out of 62 students of the class of 1904. The first ship in his naval career was battleship Missouri. The symbolism of this assignment would only become apparent 40 years later."

"In the early 1920s, Halsey, who hardly ever disembarked from a ship during his service, was suddenly appointed as a U.S. naval attaché in Germany and Scandinavia. In 1930, he commanded a division of destroyers. Then, to pave the way to the rank of admiral, Halsey studied at the U.S. Naval War College for senior officers. In 1935, he was assigned as commander of USS Saratoga, one of the most powerful U.S. Navy aircraft carriers of that time. However, this position required completion of an air observer course. Halsey didn't like this perspective, as he thought it would be much better to control the airplane himself rather than being the \"second person in the cockpit\".\n"
"\n"
"In 1935, the 52-years-old Halsey completed the full course of a naval pilot, and became the oldest man in the history of the U.S. Navy to earn the Naval Aviator's Wings. Being one of the few at that time, Halsey, same as his future opponent Yamamoto Isoroku, became a big advocate for naval aviation, foreseeing that aircraft carriers will be the greatest power in the future war in the ocean."

"On the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, Vice Admiral Halsey, who was in charge of the task force headed by USS Enterprise, was far from the Hawaii base, as the storm had delayed their arrival. After learning of the Japanese attack, the admiral, who had an explosive temper, let the hatred for the new enemy grow in his heart. Chester W. Nimitz, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, realized that Halsey's aggression and restlessness was just the right thing for the American seamen depressed by the Pearl Harbor disaster. For this reason, in early 1942, it was Halsey who, with the help of his carrier task force, held a series of lightning-like \"hit-and-run\" raids on the Japanese strongholds. After James Doolittle's bombers took off for the Tokyo Raid from the deck of Halsey's aircraft carriers, the name of William Halsey became a personification of the belief in victory over Japan for every American.\n"

"In October of 1942, after taking the command over the South Pacific forces, Halsey led the persistent fight for Guadalcanal, one of the Solomon Islands, that was a key to the entire Pacific Campaign."

"The 20th century rumbled in under thunders of naval gunfire. The outcome of many a war—the Sino-Japanese War, the Spanish–American War, the Russo-Japanese War—was effectively settled at sea. Based on experience gained in those wars, navies of the world powers developed new technical specifications for the major types of their ships.\n"
"\n"
"In armored shipbuilding, there was a shift toward battleships with eight to twelve main battery guns of 305 mm or more in caliber, a new armor protection system, increased speed provided by the adoption of turbines, and improved resistance to flooding. The construction of such ships was a topic of discussion in many countries. England, with its highly developed economy and advanced shipbuilding technologies, took the lead. The Royal Navy's HMS Dreadnought was a revolutionary ship that gave its name to the type. All pre-dreadnought battleships abruptly became obsolete, plunging all world powers into a new naval arms race in which only those countries with the mightiest economies could prevail.\n"
"\n"
"In cruiser building, warships became ever more narrowly specialized, with a large series of high-speed cruisers created specifically for combat operations within squadrons. Speed emerged as one of a warship's primary operational characteristics. To achieve the desired result and maintain an acceptable displacement, cruisers began to switch from coal-fired reciprocating engines to steam turbines and oil burning.\n"
"\n"
"For destroyers, this process happened even more rapidly. Destroyers were to be agile and fast enough to be able to reach the most advantageous position and moment for an attack. The role of destroyers, according to the experience of past wars at sea, had increased dramatically. Aside from active operations in battles, they carried out their \"routine,\" yet important, duties such as reconnaissance, patrolling, and planting of mines. For that purpose, destroyers began to be equipped with 102–120 mm guns. The use of fixed underwater torpedo tubes was discontinued in favor of deck-mounted multitube torpedo units placed on a rotating base. Ships were equipped with devices for receiving and planting a large number of mines from the upper deck. All this turned destroyers into a deadly threat for surface ships of all types.\n"
"\n"
"The chance to test those numerous new features in naval construction came pretty soon—in 1914, World War I broke out."

msgstr ""
"During World War I, the evolution of warships of the major types revolved around the simple core idea of making them larger and stronger. The increasingly large caliber of their guns was complemented by their ever-stronger armor protection, which resulted in more significant water displacement and bigger proportions. For battleships, the race was initiated by the British when they designed a series of Queen Elizabeth-class warships with a sharp increase in their main gun caliber (up to 381 mm). Germany promptly responded with its Bayern-class super-dreadnoughts, which carried the same super-heavy artillery. The German ships, however, outmatched their rivals in terms of armor and combat durability. Their aim was to achieve superiority in quality, as it was impossible to compete with or match the sheer number of ships in the British fleet. Perhaps the only really important novelty in this race for world shipbuilding supremacy emerged when the Americans adopted \"all or nothing\" armor, not typical of warships of the pre-dreadnought era, on their Nevada-class battleships. The new scheme involved heavily armoring the areas most important to a ship, while the remainder received significantly less armor to emphasize protection optimized for long-range engagement. By a twist of fate, the strongest battleships of that period were eventually built by Japan, a country that had, until that time, stayed away from the main theaters of military activity. Hardly any rival ship was on par with their Nagato-class warships in terms of speed, armor and armament combined.\n"
"\n"
"During the war, only two European states could afford to build large series of new cruisers—Germany and Great Britain. The trends were the same: when the main caliber of the German cruisers reached 150 mm, the British designed ships of the Hawkins class with 190 mm guns, which became the prototype of a totally new subclass of ships—the heavy cruiser. The Americans and Japanese, in turn, carefully considered their military experience in relation to their own objectives. Built to scout for a fleet of U.S. battleships, the Omaha-class light cruisers featured high speed for cooperation with allied destroyers, and 152 mm guns to fend off any enemy destroyers that might be sent their way. The Japanese, in turn, reinforced their fleet of warships with several series of Kuma- and Nagara-class 5,500-ton light cruisers. Any of the them could be used as both a reconnaissance ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer flotillas during massively overwhelming torpedo attacks.\n"
"\n"
"Destroyers were undoubtedly the most active fighting ships during World War I, which is why they would generally be considered the navy's expendable assets. In addition to raiding operations, patrolling and mine laying, this type of ship assumed another military role—anti-submarine warfare—which resulted in corresponding changes being made to their design and armament. The general trend, however, was the same: destroyers received ever more weapons, and the caliber of their guns grew, along with their displacement and speed. During the war, for the first time in the Royal Navy, a new sub-type of ships appeared: destroyer flotilla leaders, the role of which approached light cruisers in terms their characteristics and objectives.\n"
"\n"
"World War I demonstrated clearly that, during a global conflict, only a few economically powerful countries that had steered clear of direct combat were capable of building the major ship types on a massive scale. But it was clear even to them that the uncontrolled naval arms race was accelerating beyond their capabilities."

msgid "IDS_PCQM093_SHIPS_DESCR"
msgstr ""
"The economic consequences of World War I were so devastating that even the greatest winning states had to commit to something they once thought impossible—conclude a treaty on the limitation of naval armament. From 1922, for the first time in history, naval officials and shipbuilders had to be guided not by operational or strategic considerations, or optimal technical solutions, but primarily by the articles of the Washington Naval Treaty. This treaty contained restrictions on the number, displacement, and armament for the major types of the vessels of war. In addition, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary ceased to rank among the naval powers at that time. It is not surprising, therefore, that the \"Washington Treaty\" period in the history of military shipbuilding turned out to be a rather difficult one.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, no capital ships were allowed to be built for a period of ten years. At the signing of the treaty, the contracting powers retained their most advanced capital ships in their respective navies. The only exception was the Nelson class of British battleships built during that period. To comply with the limitations of the Washington Treaty, these ships were of an unusual design with all three main battery turrets carried forward of the ship's bridge, an arrangement unlikely to be used under normal circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"The Washington Treaty had a more profound effect on cruiser building. Cruisers were limited in terms of quality, but not numbers. Since battleships were no longer allowed to be built, the major naval powers began a competition to build \"treaty cruisers\" using the maximum values for technical specifications allowed by the treaty. To obey the limits on total cruiser displacement established for each navy, designers were forced to make compromises which normally affected armor protection. As a result, during the second half of the 1920s, Great Britain, France, Italy, the U.S.A., and Japan possessed ships boasting a high speed, a 203 mm main battery, and good seaworthiness, all at the cost of very weak armor. Warships of this new subtype, the need for which was never dictated by any objective naval warfare needs, were collectively known as the \"Washington Treaty Cruisers\".\n"
"\n"
"The treaty for the limitation of naval armament likewise had an effect on the brand new type of warship—aircraft carriers. In 1922, the number of capital ships employed on fleet duties was sharply reduced. The hulls of the newest battleships and battle cruisers, which were being outfitted at shipyards, could either be scrapped, or converted into aircraft carriers. This way, by the end of the 1920s, the U.S.A., Japan, and Great Britain came to own large, high-speed aircraft carriers that were used to work through basic design solutions and tactics that were later adopted on this type of massively produced, purpose-built ship.\n"
"\n"
"The trends in the development of destroyers in the post-war years did not change—their size grew, and their armament became deadlier. France and Italy competed in creating ever larger and faster warships, equipped with increasingly more powerful artillery, eventually blurring the line between these ships and light cruisers. During the years of \"forced enthusiasm\" for the construction of \"Washington Treaty\" warships, only a few ships of this subtype were built. However, the real breakthrough came with the appearance of the Japanese destroyers of the Fubuki class and their successors—the Hatsuharu class. Powerful artillery, and most importantly, the crippling long-range 610 mm torpedoes coupled with a unique system of fast reload right at sea, propelled the destroyer forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy to a leading position in the world.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, as the shock from the world war passed, Germany and the U.S.S.R., the heir to the Russian Empire, again sought to join the ranks of the world's leading powers on land and at sea. For many signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty, naval arms limitations became increasingly difficult to put up with."

"World War II overturned the entire system of limitations on naval armament that existed in the 1920s and 30s, bringing international shipbuilding back to its natural state. From that moment on, every decision was dominated by the need for warships, production capacities, technology, and time. It is not surprising then that the United States was the only country that expressed a wish to build a series of battleships during these years. The Iowa-class battleships fit perfectly into the new format of naval warfare, changing their inherent role from hunting for high-speed Japanese battlecruisers to ensuring the stability of fast aircraft carrier strike formations. It is generally accepted that with all of their performance characteristics combined, they were the best battleships of World War II, but this honorary title is contested by the Japanese giants of the Yamato class. In contrast to them, the last battleship of the Royal Navy—Vanguard—looked much weaker, despite her excellent seaworthiness.\n"
"\n"
"A similar situation unfolded during World War II in cruiser building. It was possible in this period to create well-balanced and powerful ships, but only the United States and Great Britain had the resources to do so. As a result, the U.S. Navy received a large series of Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, the largest of their type, as well as light cruisers of the Cleveland class. The former ones were the strongest wartime heavy cruisers, balanced so well in terms of armament, armor protection, and seaworthiness that they remained in service for many years. Their enhanced versions served as the basis for the design of the Des Moines-class heavy cruisers equipped with auto-loading main battery guns, and these ships embodied all the experience gained during World War II. Armed with 203 mm main guns and representing the pinnacle of cruiser building under the Washington Naval Treaty, they were the best representatives of the latest generation of heavy artillery ships. In the light cruiser type, they were matched by the ships of the Worcester class, which also entered service after the war and carried a battery of 152 mm automatic dual-purpose guns.\n"
"\n"
"The most massively produced surface ships of the World War II period were destroyers, as they were involved in all impactful battles in all theaters of military activity. But despite mass production, the loss rate of this type of ship was the highest. Unlike heavy artillery ships, new classes of destroyers entered service during the war, not only in huge series joining the U.S. Navy (Fletcher, Gearing) but also in large numbers in the Royal Navy, as well as in noticeable numbers in Japan (Yūgumo, Akizuki) and Germany (various series of the 1936 class). After the war, new artillery destroyers were designed by those countries that could not afford to have larger ships in sufficient numbers. Fortunately, in terms of displacement and armament, the destroyers of that time often matched pre-war light cruisers: the Battle and Daring classes of Great Britain, the Halland class of Sweden, and the Friesland class of the Netherlands.\n"
"\n"
"The era when steam turbine-driven warships dominated the seas extended over a short period by historical measures—only about half a century, almost coinciding in time with the first half of the 20th century. However, despite being short, it encompassed as many as several different epochs."

As a result of the intensive maneuvering, at some point of the battle the cruiser got a chance to lead the entire squadron for some time. More than once Nisshin found herself under concentrated gun fire from Russian armored cruisers. Three of her four main battery guns were destroyed and about 100 crew members were lost or injured, which made her one of Japan's most battle-scarred ships. Takano Isoroku was also heavily injured in the explosion of the 203 mm gun of the fore end turret."

"Courbet entered service in 1913 as the lead ship in the first series of French dreadnoughts. The ship was named in honor of Amédée Courbet (1827–1885), a French admiral who won a series of important naval victories during the Sino-French War of 1884–1885 and died of cholera soon after.\n"
"\n"
"During World War I, Courbet participated in battles in the Mediterranean as the flagship of the French fleet. In the 1920–1930s, the ship underwent several upgrades. The outbreak of World War II found this veteran ship in the north of France. In June 1940, Courbet rained the full power of her main battery down on the German motorized regiments approaching Cherbourg. In 1941, while serving in the Free French Naval Forces, the ship participated in the defense of Portsmouth, England, against the Luftwaffe attacks. In 1944, she was disarmed, and her hull was used as a breakwater during the construction of a temporary harbor for landing Allied troops in Normandy."

"Battleship Bretagne was commissioned in 1916. She was named in honor of Bretagne—a historical province in the north-west of France, where the largest centers of shipbuilding are situated, in Lorient and Brest. The biggest naval base of the French Navy on the Atlantic coast is also located in Brest.\n"
"\n"
"In March–April 1940, Bretagne and heavy cruiser Algérie, as part of the special Force X, fulfilled an unusual mission to carry gold across the Atlantic Ocean. The German submarines were stalking them from below, and the Kriegsmarine raiders—battleships and cruisers—often went out to hunt. That is why using warships as carriers of the precious metal was more than justified. Bretagne and Algérie delivered 147 tons of gold from Toulon to Halifax that was then used to pay for the French government's military contracts placed in the U.S.A. On the way back, the battleship and cruiser escorted transports with 82 warplanes on board that were purchased in the U.S.A."

"It was in France where one of the most successful and well-balanced battleships of the new generation were built. Richelieu officially entered service in July 1940, after France had capitulated. When the ship was based in Dakar, in July and September 1940, she participated in battles against English forces that were attempting to gain control over the French ships or neutralize them out of fear that they would be captured by Germany.\n"
"\n"
"In 1942, after the French colonies in Africa had defected to the Allies, Richelieu sailed to the U.S.A. for a major refit. Once back in service, the ship was sent to assist the British Home Fleet in operations near the shores of Norway. From spring 1944 until the end of the war, Richelieu served with the combined forces of the Allies, actively operating in the Indian Ocean, raining fire on nearby islands seized by Japanese garrisons."

"Battleship Dunkerque was commissioned in 1937, becoming the forerunner of a new generation of battleships with powerful guns, good armor and, most importantly, high speed. The maximum speed of the new French battleship exceeded 30 knots which made her an extremely dangerous hunter for cruisers.\n"
"\n"
"When World War II broke out, Dunkerque was unusually in demand since at that time the Allies didn't have other modern high-speed battleships capable of countering German raiders. In Autumn 1939, Dunkerque and her sister ship Strasbourg operated in the Atlantic against the German \"pocket\" battleships Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee. That same year, in November, amid a violent storm, Dunkerque and the British battleship Hood set out on a hunt for German Scharnhorst-class battleships. In December, Dunkerque transported 100 tons of gold across the Atlantic to be used as payment under military orders. On the way back, she escorted a convoy with Canadian soldiers."

"Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne (1611–1675), is one of the most prominent French generals. He joined the army as a private during the Thirty Years' War but displayed such daring and skill that he rose meteorically in rank, becoming a Marshal of France at 33. Turenne's innovative approach based on fearless maneuvering on the battlefield and concentrating troops along the main sector of the front helped him secure several brilliant victories during the wars with Spain and Holland. The glorious Marshal's life was taken by an enemy cannonball in his next battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French Navy paid their respects to Turenne by assigning his name to two large battle units—a 100-gun ship-of-the-line launched in 1854 and an ironclad that entered service in 1882. Early in the 20th century, France was considering a project to build an \"all-big-gun\" battleship as a next step in the evolution of the Danton-class pre-dreadnought battleships, also to be named after one of the most prominent figures in French history."

"Armand Jean du Plessis, the famous Cardinal Richelieu, was one of the most influential statesmen in France and essentially the founder of the French Navy. Before Richelieu, the kingdom couldn't boast any organized navy. He helped create a fleet that would be recognized as a significant naval force in the international arena. The Cardinal himself was involved in designing the exterior decor and armament of one of the most powerful ships of that time—the 70-gun Couronne (\"Crown\").\n"
"\n"
"The first warship to be named after Richelieu was an ironclad that joined the fleet in 1876. The next large combat unit of the Marine Nationale to carry the Cardinal's name was a battleship (displacement: 35,000 tons) that was laid down at the Brest Arsenal in 1935. That battleship turned out to be one of the best ships of her type in Europe."

"In 1938, driven by further aggravation of the international situation, the French government decided to build a second pair of Richelieu-class battleships. However, significant changes were made to the project designs at the development stage with the last ship carrying the name of a historical province in the south-west of France—Gascogne—designed almost from scratch.\n"
"\n"
"Gascogne's main difference from Richelieu was a more conventional placement of the main battery turrets—at the fore and aft ends of the ship. Other important changes were the shift of the propulsion unit closer to the ship's fore end and reinforcement of her AA defenses by increasing the number of 100 mm and 37 mm guns. The keel-laying that had been postponed several times was ultimately to take place in the summer of 1940. But after France withdrew from the war in June of the same year, preparations for the construction of the battleship ceased. The preceding warship Gascogne, one in a series of Normandie-class battleships, did not fare any better. Laid down in 1913 while still under construction, she was decommissioned for scrap."

"In 1910–1911, specially for the first French dreadnoughts of the Courbet class, a new 305 mm twin turret was developed. The main advantage of the new construction, which distinguished it from previous ones, was inclined armored plates which turned out to be more durable. However, the guns in the turrets were almost the same as those mounted on the last French pre-dreadnought battleships of the Danton class.\n"
"\n"
"The turrets had up to 290 mm of armor and the loading gear was designed to fire up to two 432 kg AP shells per minute. The main disadvantage of Courbet's turrets was a small gun elevation angle (12 degrees only), which significantly decreased the ship's firing range. That shortcoming was fixed only during a major ship refit of 1922–1924 when the angle was increased to 23 degrees."

"In 1912, a decision was finally reached to proceed with building the third series of battleships for the French Navy. However, plans to make new ships of the Normandie class more powerful than their predecessors were hindered by production constraints, as at that time French shipyards were not big enough to allow for any significant increase in the size of warships. Moreover, the French didn't have guns that were more powerful than the 340 mm guns, which were to be mounted on the Bretagne-class battleships that were at their final stages of construction, and the design of a new gun weapon system would be too expensive timewise. Ultimately, engineers came up with an innovative solution: to mount the main guns intended for the Normandie-class battleships in quad turrets.\n"
"\n"
"The new turret, which would have become the first quad turret ever mounted on a ship, was designed to have a rate of fire of up to two shots per minute. The front armor plates protecting the guns were to have been 340 mm thick. In total, plans were made to build 31 units: each of the five Normandie-class battleships laid down in 1913–1914 was supposed to carry three such turrets, while the Lyon-class warships ordered in 1915 were designed to carry as many as four."

The decision to place main guns in quad turrets was necessitated by the intention to provide the new battleships with the most powerful armament allowed by limited displacement without decreasing their speed and armor protection.\n"
"\n"
"The design of the 380 mm quad turrets was in many ways based on the construction of 330 mm turrets used on the previous—Dunkerque—class of battleships. This allowed to promptly do away with the design phase and commence construction. Eventually, such turrets were mounted aboard two battleships only, Richelieu and Jean Bart, although plans were made for similar units to be carried by Clemenceau (laid down in 1939) and Gascogne (suggested keel-laying year: 1940). Quad turrets housing 380 mm guns were also envisaged by one of the draft projects for the Alsace-class battleships developed in the spring of 1940."

To accommodate French standards, the planes were renamed as Curtiss CW-77, and were urgently reequipped with French machine guns and camouflaged accordingly.\n"

"However, as America had declared neutrality, it couldn't deliver bombers directly to France. A plan was devised to move the biplanes to Halifax, Canada, where they were to be fetched by the French aircraft carrier Bearn. At the last moment, the planes were prohibited to cross the Canadian border by air. They had to be dragged across the border using tractors and trucks available in the vicinity. At the beginning of June 1940, all biplanes were finally loaded on the carrier. The news about the capitulation of France reached Bearn near the island of Martinique.

"As a result, in 1905, a project to create a cruiser with a displacement of 3,700 tons and a speed of 24 knots was undertaken. Very high boards were one of her constructive peculiarities, which allowed her to maintain a high speed, even during a storm. Originally, the armament of the ship should have included only 76 mm guns, which were recognized as powerful enough to counter destroyers of that time, but during the design, some of them were replaced with 127 mm guns.\n"

Thanks to the newest radar mounted on it, USS Helena was the first to disclose the approach of a Japanese squadron. Allowing the enemy ships to approach at a close distance, the cruiser was the first to burst her rapid fire at the Japanese.

The technological level of the previous, pre-dreadnought era ships did not allow for the creation of sufficiently reliable turret mounts with high-speed gun movement to improve aim at the target.

In 1932, for the new generation of light cruisers, the Mark 16 gun was developed. It was designed for a \"super-heavy\" shell weighing 59 kg, significantly superior to its counterparts in destructive power.

A relatively small initial velocity of heavy shell and close location of the barrels in the turret had an adverse effect on the firing accuracy over long distances. However, the turret's ability to shoot up to 30 shells per minute made it an extremely formidable weapon in close- and medium-ranged battles.

Such impressive features came at the cost of the mount's relatively large size and the immense weight of the turrets highly charged with mechanisms.

The turret guns had a nominal rate of fire of 15 shots per minute, but that could be increased for a short period of time, shooting up to 22 shells—each weighing about 25 kg—per minute.\n"

"One of the first AA guns of the U.S. Navy, the Mark 10 with a caliber of 76 mm, was developed in 1913–1915 on the basis of an earlier system, the Mark 6, widely used as a secondary battery on U.S. ships built in the 1900s. The Mark 10 gun could fire at elevation angles of up to 85 degrees. Formally, it had a dual purpose, as it could theoretically attack both air and surface targets. However, the Mark 10 was not sufficiently effective in either. In the first case, because it had only manual aiming, in the second case, because the shells were too light.\n"
"\n"
"Until the late 1920s, 76 mm Mark 10 guns were almost the sole AA artillery systems mounted on large warships of the U.S. Navy. New York-class battleships were among the first to receive them during rearmament in 1916.\n"

"The M2 Browning machine gun was developed in the United States in 1932, and since then has been very extensively used in all types of the country's armed forces. Its anti-aircraft version appeared in the Navy the following year. The machine gun's rate of fire was quite high, about 500 shots per minute, but rapid development of military aviation in the 1930s prevented 12.7 mm machine guns from being effective when firing at high-speed air targets.\n"
"\n"
"Until the late 1930s, when 28 mm AA guns were created, there was no short-range AA defense system in the U.S. Navy that could serve as an alternative to the M2 Browning. As a result, 12.7 mm machine guns could be found on nearly all American cruisers until 1941.\n"

"Development of the first American automatic AA defense system began in 1929 and was completed by 1934, when the resultant quadruple 28 mm mount could be brought into production. However, the tests revealed numerous deficiencies in the system. It took several years to eliminate them, so the new weapons were only delivered to the Navy in 1940.\n"
"\n"
"The automatic 28 mm mount had a rate of fire of up to 150 shots per minute and was the first U.S. Navy AA defense system with power drive. Because of its low reliability, the 28 mm mount very quickly got its rather disrespectful nickname, Chicago Piano.\n"
"\n"
"Since the production rates of these systems could not meet the ever growing requirements of the Navy, they were never widely deployed on large warships. In 1942, after the beginning of mass production of 40 mm Bofors AA guns that considerably exceeded the Chicago Piano in their effective firing range, reliability, and power, the 28 mm guns were taken out of production."

"At the core of the Oerlikon, the most widespread AA defense gun of World War II, was the design of a 20 mm German gun developed by Reinhold Becker in 1913–1915. The Becker gun, which had a high rate of fire and light weight for its time, was intended for mounting on airplanes and the legendary Zeppelins. From Germany, demilitarized after World War I, the production of the 20 mm gun was moved to the Swiss company SEMAG, and then, after its collapse, to Oerlikon.\n"
"\n"
"Initially, the Swiss version of the 20 mm gun did not have any impressive characteristics. In 1935, the U.S.A., having purchased samples of the gun for testing, refused to use Oerlikons, which put the Swiss company on the brink of bankruptcy. Ironically, Oerlikon managed to continue working on improvements to the gun's design thanks to Japan which purchased a license for production of the 20 mm guns. Japanese Oerlikons, designated as Type 99, became the basis for the armament of the famous Zero fighter aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"In 1940, during the war, the United States began looking for a replacement for the obsolete and weak Browning AA machine guns. The 20 mm automatic Oerlikon, significantly improved by that time, proved to be very useful. In 1941, its production was deployed in the U.S.A., and soon the Oerlikons were mounted on almost every warship, from boats to battleships."

"Reliability, a high rate of fire (up to 120 shots per minute), considerable height of engagement (over 6 km), destructive force of the shells (projectile weight of 900 g)—this all made the 40 mm automatic gun, developed by the Swedish company Bofors in 1930–1933, the most widespread AA artillery system. In the 1940s–1950s, it was used by dozens of countries around the world.\n"
"\n"
"Production of the 40 mm Bofors in the United States began in 1941, but the Swedish gun did not satisfy the Navy in many respects, so the Americans introduced many improvements in the mount's design using, among other things, the British version of the Bofors. The mass production of the 40 mm guns was deployed only at the end of 1942, yet they managed to satisfy the Navy's requirements in full only by 1944, when Bofors was able to finally replace the ineffective 28 mm Chicago Pianos on ships.\n"
"\n"
"The Bofors was produced in a variety of versions: with air and water cooling, in twin, quadruple, and single mounts, with manual aiming and with a power drive. A little more than ten thousand mounts were manufactured for the Navy and Coast Guard, over twenty thousand for the army, and around nine thousand were supplied to allied countries."

In such a situation, simply hitting a high-flying aircraft was not enough, it had to be destroyed in the air before it approached the ship. Small caliber Bofors and Oerlikon AA defense guns were not up to the task, so the U.S. Navy had to find a solution to the problem quickly.\n"
"\n"
"It was decided to return 76 mm guns to the AA artillery in more advanced power-driven mounts. Only after the war was the most efficient 76 mm AA gun developed—the twin Mark 33. This weapon which had a very high aiming speed (24 degrees per second horizontally, 30 degrees per second vertically), the ability to fire up to 50 shells per minute from each barrel, exhaustive destructive force of the projectile, with a maximum engagement of over 9 km in height, crowned the development of American AA defense systems in the 1940s.\n"

"The first warship in the Royal Navy to be named after the Battle of Jutland was a Battle-class destroyer that began her active duty in 1947, and received a badge depicting a Sea Griffin. The new destroyers, built in several series and named after significant British victories on land and at sea, were the Admiralty's response to the threat of air attacks, which had drastically increased by that time. From 1942 through 1945, a total of 40 ships were laid down, with the construction of two more destroyers for the Royal Australian Navy starting in 1946. At the end of World War II, the Battle-class destroyers were no longer needed in such great numbers, resulting in the completion of only 26 ships of this class.\n"
"\n"
"HMS Jutland and her sister ships conceptually differed from the destroyers of the preceding class in that they were armed with up-to-date and fully-fledged dual-purpose main battery artillery, comprising four or five 113 mm guns. Thanks to the mass production of Bofors and Oerlikon mounts set up in Britain and the U.S., all small-caliber anti-aircraft artillery of Battle-class destroyers consisted of these mounts, which noticeably out-matched the British Pom-Pom's and 12.7 mm machine guns in terms of performance characteristics. However, these ships had just a few occasions to use their powerful AA defenses in practice. Only one destroyer from this series, HMS Barfleur, managed to see action during World War II as a member of the British Pacific Fleet. HMS Jutland did her military service in peacetime and finished it in 1965."

"The Royal Navy giving the name Daring to its warships was a tradition dating back to the early 19th century. The sixth ship to bear this name was a destroyer. Laid down in September 1945, HMS Daring and her sister ships were the pinnacle of development of this ship type in Britain, being the largest and most powerful destroyers ever to serve in the navies of the British Commonwealth. Their characteristic feature, in addition to powerful anti-submarine armament, was anti-aircraft artillery whose gun fire control system, together with the main battery's automatic aiming system, which allowed them to simultaneously fire at two targets within the short- and long-range zones of the ship's AA defenses.\n"
"\n"
"The superiority of the new ships over the other representatives of this ship type was so great that from 1953 to 1957 they were not officially classified as destroyers, but were instead referred to as \"Darings\"—taking the name of the lead ship of the series. Eight ships of this class were inducted into the Royal Navy in the period spanning 1952–1954. Later, four more of these ships were laid down for the Royal Australian Navy, but only three of them would be completed. HMS Daring, the lead ship of the class, served in the Royal Navy from 1952 to 1971."

"The Mark IX gun was designed in the late 1920s to replace outdated systems of the same caliber that had been in use since World War I. The new gun had twice the rate of fire and was capable of firing up to 12 shells per minute, with each projectile weighing 22 kg. The elevation angle of the first mounts was 30 degrees, which later was increased to 40, and then further to 55 degrees. The maximum range of fire at the elevation of 30 degrees was about 14.5 km.\n"
"\n"
"Most destroyers built in Britain between 1930 and 1940 were armed with the Mark IX gun model for their main battery artillery. All so-called \"standard\" destroyers starting from the A class, up to the I class, as well as several series of ships of from the time of war, carried four single-mounts each. The J-, K-, N-, and Tribal-class destroyers were equipped with the same guns, but placed in twin-mounts. Fast-firing and quite powerful Mark IX guns were well-suited to hit-and-run battles at short- and mid-range, which is why British sailors valued them so much. The major drawback of this system, that prominently manifested itself in the very first months of World War II, was its inability to effectively fire at airborne targets. The poor ability of the Mark IX to repel the attacks of the Luftwaffe's dive bombers, the nemeses of British destroyers, forced the British Admiralty to focus on the development of dual-purpose guns."

"The best-known British anti-aircraft gun appeared during World War I. It was designed by the Vickers company and went into service from 1915 under the designation \"2-pounder Mark II gun\". The gun was nicknamed the pom-pom because of the characteristic sound it produced when firing. Mark II guns were almost solely produced as single-mounts with manual aiming. Some of the initial pom-pom guns would also be used during World War II, mostly on mobilized civil vessels.\n"
"\n"
"The early 1920s saw the start of development of a 40 mm multi-barreled AA gun with a power drive. Due to poor funding, typical of the British Admiralty in the 1920s, the process of accepting the new gun into service was a very long one. Only in the early 1930s did the navy start to receive the first 40 mm AA Mark VIII guns, initially placed in octuple mounts. The new gun had the same barrel as the Mark II, which is why it inherited the pom-pom nickname. In 1935, a quadruple mount was designed which would become the basis for the AA armament of British destroyers starting from the Tribal class. The 2-pounder's rate of fire was around 100 shots per minute with its effective vertical range of fire being just a little above 1 km and the shell weighing a little over 900 grams. The pom-pom gun was inferior in terms of almost all performance characteristics in comparison to Bofors AA automatic guns of the same caliber. The latter though were under-produced, which is why they never superseded the presence of pom-pom guns on British ships."

"The Vickers company developed the 12.7 mm AA machine gun in the mid-1920s. However, it wasn't until 1932 that it entered into service in the Royal Navy. Since the navy did not have any other small caliber AA systems at that time, the Vickers guns became very widespread. In the 1930s and early 1940s, it was present on virtually all ships of the Royal Navy, from battleships to minesweepers.\n"
"\n"
"The Vickers quadruple mount was the most popular of its kind in the navy. It had to be aimed manually, with a practicable rate of fire of around 150–200 shots per minute, and an effective vertical range of fire a bit higher than 700 m. By the mid-1930s, the 12.7 mm machine gun was considered to be ineffective against up-to-date combat aircraft of that time. However, the British Navy would have no alternative to this weapon until the massive shipments of 20 mm Oerlikon automatic guns commenced. In particular, the quadruple 12.7 mm Vickers machine guns formed the basis of the AA defenses of British \"standard\" destroyers, starting from the D class."

The elevation angle of its guns, placed in turrets, was 80 degrees, the range of fire at surface targets was 19 km, and the effective vertical range of fire exceeded 12 km. The 25 kg shell of the new 113 mm gun was heavier than the projectile of the \"standard\" 120 mm Mark IX gun. The essential advantages of the new mount were its ability to automatically aim at targets and its mechanized supply of ammunition, which enhanced its rate of fire to 24 shots per minute.\n"
"\n"
"Two Battle-class destroyers of the Royal Australian Navy, commissioned between 1950 and 1951, were the first to carry these new dual-purpose turrets. The first British ship to receive Mark VI guns as their main battery artillery was HMS Daring, commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1952. The last ships of the British Navy armed with these guns were decommissioned in the 1980s. The navies of some countries still have these guns in their arsenal."

This operation preserved the lives and freedom of trained military personnel, enabling them to continue their fight in the war. With the cost of the operation being a number of ships and small vessels sunk, the quick decisions made by the navy, improvising at every turn, and the incredible dedication shown by British sailors, soldiers, and civilians, worked miracles in those days.\n"
"\n"
"Nearly forty of the Royal Navy destroyers that participated in Operation Dynamo accounted for around a third of all evacuees. Initially, the warships assembled for the operation only intended to cover the boarding of the evacuated soldiers onto civilian ships. However, it would have been nearly impossible to save as many if the original plan was stuck to. So, on the night of May 28, by the light of the fires raging in the city tormented by the Luftwaffe, HMS Wakeful and HMS Gallant were the first to enter Dunkirk's harbor and board soldiers directly from the embankments, while other destroyers joined the evacuation from nearby beaches. On the morning of May 29, during another round of evacuation, Wakeful, loaded with hundreds of soldiers, was sunk by a German submarine. On the same day, Gallant, having survived an air raid, hit a mine and could not continue her part in the operation."

Clearly, the one most readily available was protective (\"khaki\") or black paint that was applied in spots on top of the standard gray.

In 1890, after his father's death, Luigi Amedeo inherited the title of Duke of Abruzzo from his uncle, Umberto I, the King of Italy. The prince was one of the outstanding representatives of his time. He made three voyages around the world in his lifetime, becoming the first man to climb the second highest peak of Canada and the USA, Mount St. Elias, aged 24. When he was 26, he led an expedition to the North Pole, during which he reached Franz Joseph Land, but was forced to return because of severe frostbite. In 1906, Luigi Amedeo was the first to conquer the highest summit (over 5,000 m) of the Rwenzori massif in Equatorial Africa. Three years later, in the course of an expedition to conquer the second highest peak of the world, K2 or Chogori, he set a world record by climbing to a height of 6,250 m.\n"
"As the Vice-Admiral of the Regia Marina (Italian for Royal Navy) during World War I, Prince Luigi Amedeo led the Italian fleet that fought in the Adriatic Sea. In 1920, he began the project of his lifetime – establishing a settlement in Italian Somalia with the aim of studying and introducing the most up-to-date farming methods. Through the efforts of the prince, who invested his personal funds into the construction of roads, schools, and hospitals, the settlement grew into a small city within a few years. The Duke of Abruzzi's settlement became his fate, where the prince raised a family by marrying a local resident. It was there that he died in 1933. Four years later, one of the best Italian light cruisers, Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi, was enlisted into the Regia Marina."

"Karl Martell or, in French style, Charles Martel, the famous Duke and Prince of the Franks, and de facto ruler of Francia in the first third of the 8th century. His military and political genius allowed him to crush all his rivals, repel the Saracen invasion that could have been disastrous for the country, and unite the Franks' lands under his power, laying the foundations for the power of his legendary grandson, Charlemagne (French for Charles the Great).\n"
"The military campaign of Charles Martel, undertaken in 734, was a rare event for the Dark Ages. In an attempt to strike the Frisians from the sea, he sent off a large fleet, invaded this Germanic tribe with its help, and defeated his enemies in the Battle of the Boarn. Battleship Charles Martel, part of the French Navy from 1897 to 1922, was named in honor of this French Mayor of the Palace. His name had another chance to enter French naval history at the beginning of World War II, when Navy Command discussed the potential names of the new heavy cruisers being designed at that time. In the list of the proposed options, Charles Martel stood alongside Henri IV, Saint Louis, and Charlemagne."

"Oleg is the legendary Russian Prince who united the two largest centers of the Eastern Slavs, Novgorod and Kiev, under his rule in the late 9th century. One of the most famous ancient Russian chronicles, The Tale of Bygone Years, tells the story of Oleg's legendary campaign against Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. According to the chronicles, the fleet assembled by the Prince for this purpose consisted of 2,000 ships. The story goes that in order to prevent the Rus people from entering the city, the Golden Horn waterway was blocked by a chain, but Oleg put his ships on wheels and proceeded to Constantinople by land. The stunned Byzantines asked for peace following this.\n"
"Naming ships of the Russian Imperial Navy in honor of the legendary characters of ancient Russian history and mythology became especially popular in the middle of the 19th century. In 1860, propeller frigate Oleg was launched in Kronstadt. The next ship that would be named in honor of the conqueror of Constantinople was the Bogatyr-class armored cruiser, laid down in St. Petersburg in 1902. The second Oleg, barely completed in the autumn of 1904 at the height of the war with Japan, was sent to the Far East as a member of the notorious 2nd Pacific Squadron. Having avoided sinking in the Battle of Tsushima, the cruiser returned to the Baltic after the war. During World War I, she participated in covering minelaying operations and carried out raids on enemy communications facilities. After the collapse of the Russian Empire, Oleg became part of the Naval Forces of the 'Workers and Peasants' Red Army. In 1919, during the Civil War, the old cruiser was sunk in Kronstadt by British torpedo boats."

Nicknamed Großer Kurfürst (German for Great Elector), he was able to turn his principality, devastated by the Thirty Years' War, into a noticeable force in Europe within just half a century of his rule. Thrifty and faithful to the ideals of strict justice, Friedrich Wilhelm was actively promoting innovation in all spheres, investing gradually and increasing the resources of the state in the development of industry, science, and education. Pursuing active foreign policy, the Great Elector not only formed a strong army but also built a rather large navy.\n"
"The first ship named in honor of Friedrich Wilhelm was a sailing frigate, launched when the Elector was still alive. In 1878, several years after the founding of the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine), the ironclad turret ship Großer Kurfürst was commissioned. It was the Elector's descendant, German Emperor Wilhelm II, who in the late 19th century set about creating a powerful navy. One of the first battleships to be launched was Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. Two decades later, in July 1914, the König-class dreadnought battleship Großer Kurfürst joined the Kaiserliche Marine. The last of the \"Great Electors\" took part in a number of combat operations during World War I, including the famous Battle of Jutland. After the defeat of Germany, she would become one of the German Navy's large ships sunk by crews in the Scapa Flow."

"In the 1880s and 1890s, the British company Armstrong built a number of so-called Elswick cruisers at the shipyard in Elswick. These were, as a rule, relatively small but well-armed, high-speed ships, with their main defense consisting of an armored deck with inclined sides. These relatively cheap cruisers were built mostly by order of countries that wanted to have their own navies but were extremely limited in resources.\n"
"In 1895, Armstrong received an order from Brazil to build three armored cruisers with a displacement of about 3,500 tons, and main armament of rapid-fire 152 mm guns. However, the customer's finances quickly ran low, which resulted in the Brazilian Navy receiving only one ship of this class, named the Almirante Barroso. The lead cruiser of the series was bought by Chile, while the third and the fourth ones – the latter being ordered by Brazil instead of the lead ship – were purchased by the United States, a country that could not be said as being limited in funds. The reason behind it was that, in 1898, at the height of the ships' construction, the Spanish-American war broke out, and the United States government feared that the Elswicks would be acquired by Spain, which needed to replenish its fleet with up-to-date combat units. As a result, from 1898–1900, USS New Orleans and USS Albany raised star-spangled banners and became the last major ships built abroad to become part of the U.S. Navy."

She was a force to be reckoned with: a displacement of nearly 16,000 tons, Krupp cemented armor, improved turret mount mechanisms that provided a rate of fire unrivaled for its time, and fourteen 152 mm guns capable of firing up to seven 45 kg shells per minute.\n"
"From the very beginning of her construction, Mikasa was destined to be the flagship of the navy. During her trial period, in early 1902, she received an original paint scheme that, became the standard for the Imperial Japanese Navy for a short period of time and was not used in any other Navy of the world. In accordance with this scheme, the ship's side, masts, and funnels were covered with black paint, while superstructures, turret mounts, and lifeboats were painted white. The unique detail that made the Navy flagship instantly recognizable was her three white stripes on each of the funnels. However, Mikasa did not pose in her black-and-white dress for too long. In early 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, becoming the swan song of the entirety of the type of squadron battleships."

However, the initial results of the implementation of this idea in shipbuilding programs were not quite satisfactory. Laid down as ocean raiders, cruisers Châteaurenault and Guichen were too expensive, and poorly armed. It was decided to consider and fix these drawbacks when building the third ship.\n"
"In November 1897, a cruiser named after the naval commander, historian, and member of the French Academy – Admiral Jean Pierre Edmond Jurien de La Gravière – was laid down at the naval shipyard in Lorient. The new ship was smaller than her predecessors, but she was almost as fast. She also had much better armament, with eight 165 mm guns in comparison to the two 165 mm and six 139 mm carried by Châteaurenault and Guichen. Extended trials delayed her commissioning, and, as a result, Jurien de la Gravière was completed only in 1903. By this time, the Command of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) completely abandoned construction of large armored cruisers, realizing that at such a high cost, their protection was too weak for a serious squadron battle."

"The Japanese carrier-based torpedo bomber Nakajima B5N, nicknamed \"Kate\" by the Americans, caused significant trouble for the Allies in the first year of the war in the Pacific. Developed by Nakajima company designers, it was adopted in 1937. Being equipped with a 1,000 hp engine in 1939, the plane received was designated \"B5N2\" and, with this modification, became the main torpedo bomber of the Japanese Navy until 1943. In terms of range, speed, and, perhaps most importantly, the reliability of its torpedo weapons, \"Kate\" was noticeably better than its American counterpart—Devastator.\n"
"\n"
"The \"moment of glory\" for B5N2 was a raid on the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The operation involved 144 aircraft of this model, and they acted both as torpedo bombers and as low-level bombers (\"Kate\" could carry up to 800 kg of bombs instead of a torpedo). Every third torpedo launched by the \"Kates\" that day found their target, leaving the U.S. Pacific Fleet with barely any battleships. In 1942, the lethal B5N2 kept on sinking Allied ships one by one in nearly every major battle. Gradually, however, the aircraft's shortcomings—weak defensive weapons and the lack of any protection—began to manifest themselves. By the beginning of 1944, the \"Kates\" had been mostly replaced by more advanced machines, although they still remained in use until the end of the war."

The codename of the aircraft, \"SBD\" (scout-bomber Douglas), was usually decoded by the army wits as Slow But Deadly. Starting with the SBD3 modification, produced since the spring of 1942, Dauntless crews were defended by effective armor, and their weapons became really deadly—four machine guns, including two large-caliber ones, and over 1,000 kg of bomb load. Such aircraft could \"dress down\" even the famous Japanese Zero fighters.\n"

Since then and until the middle of 1944, the Dauntlesses were perhaps the most formidable weapon of the U.S. Navy. Their biggest contribution to the victory of Allied forces happened at the Battle of Midway, where the bombs dropped by the SBDs turned four attack aircraft carriers—the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy—into burning ruins. The last major battle that saw the participation of these aircraft was the battle in the Philippine Sea in the summer of 1944, the famous \"Turkey Shoot\", after which the Japanese carrier fleet ceased to pose any threat."

The order to start mass production of the new aircraft, immediately dubbed as the Avenger, followed rather quickly. The plane that came off the assembly lines in the spring of 1942 was large and heavy, but actually this was its main advantage: due to the large volume of its fuel tanks, the aircraft had an unsurpassed action radius. Additionally, its capacious bomb compartment enabled it to carry a 570 mm torpedo or over 900 kg of bombs. Moreover, the torpedo bomber was armed with four machine guns, and the seats for its three crew members were well protected by armor. A powerful 1,900 hp engine ensured that this heavy load reached its destination, and at an excellent speed.\n"

"Since August 1942, each and every large-scale operation in the Pacific Theater involved Avengers. From autumn of the same year, they took part in the battle for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean as well. Their service record included the landings in North Africa, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the sinking of battleship Yamato, and the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Avengers acted both as air-to-water bombers and attack aircraft, as well as strike aircraft raiding enemy onshore positions. Equipped with radar, they proved to be wonderful reconnaissance and anti-submarine defense planes, having sunk dozens of submarines.\n"

It participated in hostilities until 1945, leaving an everlasting trace in the history of naval aviation. The Swordfish was developed by Fairey company as a torpedo bomber, reconnaissance plane, and spotting aircraft, with the first machines entering service in 1936. The biplane had rather modest speed characteristics, but at the same time it had a sufficiently large action radius and could carry more than 750 kg of weapons payload.\n"

But this impudence (very British, wouldn't you say?) turned out to be impressively beneficial. On November 12, 1940, in the still of the night, twelve Swordfishes attacked the Italian Navy base in Taranto, wrecking three battleships while losing only two aircraft. With this victory, the British torpedo bombers both changed the course of the war in the Mediterranean and made a strong statement that naval aviation had become an important strategic weapon. In May 1941, a torpedo dropped by a Swordfish made the famous Bismarck face her doom. Subsequently, this easy-to-pilot biplane, with its modest takeoff and landing condition requirements, took its well-deserved place on the decks of the small escort aircraft carriers that accompanied convoys in the Atlantic and Arctic.

However, the endless stream of discrepant requirements from the Ministry of Aviation to change the design delayed the work for almost a decade. As a result, when the production of the aircraft, named \"Barracuda\", finally commenced in 1942, its characteristics were far from impressive. The Barracuda II, which began to enter service in the Naval Air Force in early 1943, was slightly better with a more powerful 1,600 hp engine.\n"

"The not-too-fast and not-very-maneuverable Barracuda didn't make for a good torpedo bomber. But a number of constructive advantages allowed it to cope well with the role of a dive bomber. The most striking moment of its career was during operation Tungsten, which involved striking battleship Tirpitz, hiding in one of the Norwegian fjords. On April 4, 1944, forty-two Barracudas, coming in two waves, hit the battleship 14 times with their bombs, losing only three planes in the assault. The battleship was put out of action for several months. As the Air Force was obtaining American Grumman Avengers—which surpassed the Barracudas in all respects—as part of a lend-lease, the British aircraft became auxiliary planes, focusing mainly on reconnaissance, the mining of enemy harbors and fairways, anti-submarine patrols, and transporting."

"The main task of the landing signal officers was to ensure the safety of aircraft landing on the deck, and to reduce the intervals between each of their arrivals on the aircraft carrier. The signal systems in the U.S. and U.K. Navies were different, and in case of joint operations, the commanders had to coordinate which of the systems would be used each time.\n"
"\n"
"After the landing gear and hook were released, the pilot had to level the plane. Stretching his arms to the sides and inclining them, the signal officer showed the direction in which the plane had to level its wings. If necessary, he could supplement the signal by raising his foot and thus \"indicating\" how to work with a pedal."

"Until the emergence of radio communication between the pilot and the signal post in the 1950s, deck landing was corrected purely by visual signals. Before World War II, a certain set of signals had already been developed, which, as a rule, were given using special devices that resembled paddles.\n"
"\n"
"Simultaneously with the leveling of the aircraft, the landing signal officer informed the pilot what altitude he should take. The \"Hi Dip!\" signal looked like this: from the normal \"Roger\" position (arms stretched out to the sides), the LSO simultaneously raised both paddles by about 45 degrees several times until the pilot followed his instructions."

"If the landing was going well, and the pilot followed all of the instructions of the LSO, the latter gave the final signal allowing the landing. In the U.S. Navy, it was called a Cut Throttle signal because it sounded a bit like \"cut throat\". Thus, the signal resembled the movement of a hand cutting the throat."

"Laid down in January 1918, HMS Hermes was the world's first ship designed as an aircraft carrier from day one of its inception. On the basis of the results of trials held with her predecessors, ships converted from other types, changes in the new project were made even at the final stages of construction. As a result, the ship that entered service in early 1924 had all of the features of a classic aircraft carrier: a closed hangar, solid flight deck, and an island-type superstructure shifted to the starboard side. The 11,000-ton HMS Hermes could carry two dozen planes onboard and reach a speed of up to 25 knots.\n"
"\n"
"HMS Hermes spent most of her peacetime service in the Far East, looking after the interests of the British Crown in the region. One of the tasks that she had to perform—quite unusual for an aircraft carrier—was to fight against pirates. At the beginning of World War II, Hermes, based out of African ports, participated in the search for German raiders and blockade breakers in Atlantic waters. In early 1942, she was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet and arrived in Ceylon. In April of the same year, the Japanese fleet launched a raid in the Indian Ocean. On April 9, HMS Hermes, on her voyage to join with the main forces of the Eastern Fleet, was intercepted and sunk by Japanese dive bombers."

"The story how one of the first British aircraft carriers, HMS Furious, was created is quite remarkable. It was laid down in 1915 as a ship of a unique type—a light battlecruiser. When, two years later, Furious entered service, she was a strange hybrid: on her bow she had a hangar with a flight deck, while her stern was occupied by a turret with a 457 mm gun, a monstrous weapon for its time. Furious would enter service three more times, following another modernization that changed her appearance. By 1932, she had been turned into an aircraft carrier with an island-type superstructure and flight deck occupying three-quarters of her hull's length. She was capable of accelerating to nearly 30 knots and carrying more than 30 aircraft onboard.\n"
"\n"
"At the beginning of World War II, HMS Furious hunted German raiders in the Atlantic. In the spring of 1940, she took an active part in the Norwegian operation. Later on, her main goal mostly consisted of transferring aircraft to various theaters of war, from the Arctic to Malta. In late 1942, she covered the landing in North Africa and, in 1944, she participated in striking battleship Tirpitz, based in Norway. A few months prior to the end of the war in Europe, the old ship was put into reserve and then removed from the fleet lists."

"One of the best aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy, HMS Implacable entered service in August 1944. Like the Illustrious-class aircraft carriers that had been commissioned before her, she had a very important advantage—an armored flight deck. However, unlike her predecessors, HMS Implacable had a double-deck hangar, which, coupled with the possibility of placing aircraft directly on the deck, significantly increased the size of her air group.\n"
"\n"
"After entering service and until the end of 1944, Implacable took part in hostilities off the coast of Norway. In the spring of 1945, she headed for the Pacific Ocean, with the largest air group onboard ever deployed on a British aircraft carrier—81 aircraft. Throughout a period of several months until the end of World War II, HMS Implacable took part in strikes against strategic targets on the Japanese islands. After the war, for a long time, the aircraft carrier served as a training ship to test out the latest models of carrier-based aircraft. In 1949, she was the flagship of the Home Fleet. Six years later, HMS Implacable was sold for scrap."

"The 800 Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm carrier-based squadron was formed in 1933, topping the list of the \"numbered\" combat units of the Naval Air Force. Five years later, it became the first unit to receive the latest Blackburn Skua strike dive bombers. During World War II, the squadron's aircraft took off from the decks of a variety of aircraft carriers—the honored Furious, the legendary Ark Royal, and the state-of-the-art Indomitable. In April 1940, during the Norwegian campaign, the squadron was reported to have become the first ever aircraft formation to sink a major combat ship. It happened during the raid on Bergen, where Skua dive bombers sent German light cruiser Königsberg to the bottom.\n"
"\n"
"The combat geography of the 800 Naval Air Squadron is extremely extensive, with its aircraft operating in the Arctic and Mediterranean, in the hunt for Bismarck, and in covering the Allied landings in Madagascar and North Africa. In the summer of 1943, the squadron became the first Naval Air Force division to be equipped with American-made Grumman Hellcat fighters. The Hellcats of the 800 Air Squadron covered a strike of British dive bombers on battleship Tirpitz during Operation Tungsten, in April 1944. In the final stage of the war, the squadron took part in the hostilities in the Pacific."

Among them was Sergo Ordzhonikidze, the People's Commissar of Heavy Industry, who was in charge of shipbuilding and production of Soviet cars. Impressed by the crew's training level and the ship's excellent condition, he presented the cruiser Commander with the GAZ-A.\n"

"GAZ-A was the first Soviet passenger car of mass production. It was produced between 1932 and 1936 and was a licensed copy of the American Ford Model A, as it was impossible for the Soviet industry of the early 1930s to assimilate the production of an original model. A simple five-passenger phaeton, equipped with a 40 hp engine and bearing similar design to truck GAZ-AA, was supposed to be used not only for civilian needs. The Red Army was massively supplied with GAZ-A to be used mainly as a command vehicle."

"Having analyzed the experience of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the Admiralty command came to the conclusion that the main caliber guns of the new battleships should have much better ballistics and range of fire than the 305 mm, 40 caliber guns installed on the majority of the Russian squadron battleships. Initially, the armament of the designed battleship was supposed to be placed in double-gun turrets, but the Naval General Staff insisted on installation in triple turrets.\n"

"The new 305 mm, 52 caliber gun was designed at the Obukhov Plant in St. Petersburg. The first copy was made in 1907. The three-gun turret was developed at the Metal Plant in St. Petersburg. The turrets of the Baltic battleships (Sevastopol, Gangut, and others) were protected by 203 mm thick armored plates. The maximum gun elevation angle was 25 degrees, which provided a 24 km range of fire of the 1911 shell.

It was obvious that other countries would soon follow the example of the British and increase the caliber of their new dreadnoughts. In this regard, the Russian Naval Services decided to make 356 mm guns the main weapon of future ships.\n"

"It is quite natural that the guns and turrets for the battleships were designed on the basis of the Gangut/Sevastopol-type guns and turrets that had already been put into production. Being very powerful for their time, the 356 mm, 52 caliber guns, developed in 1913 at the Obukhov Plant, were able to fire 748 kg shells at a range of more than 23 km at a maximum turret elevation angle of 25 degrees, according to the project. In 1914, World War I was the reason the Empire's industry diverted to the more pressing issues. As a result, work on neither the battleships nor the turrets was ever completed. The 356 mm gun only was put into operation in test range equipment operated during the Leningrad defense of World War II."

However, in early December 1790, General Alexander Suvorov joined the command of the besiegers, and the fate of Izmail was decided. \"I came here with the troops. Twenty-four hours for reflection, and you will be given freedom. My first shot will mean your captivity. When we assault, only death awaits you\". This was Suvorov's ultimatum to the Turks.

In the midst of the Great Patriotic War, Bespolov led the development of Project 24, a further development of Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. The design of these ships was to take into account the experience of World War II and embody the most advanced achievements of Soviet shipbuilding. Both 406 mm and 457 mm guns were considered as options for battleships armament.

The third ship in the series was Enseigne Gabolde, which was completed only in 1923 under a design altered to draw on the experience gained during the war. The destroyer turned out to significantly outgun her former sister ships. Enseigne Gabolde's main battery guns were turned into dual-purpose ones, comprising three 100 mm guns. Another alteration was to equip this destroyer with twin-tube torpedo launchers.

Even relatively small \"Bourrasques\" were almost double the size of their prewar predecessors. The use of 130 mm guns on series-produced destroyers in the 1920's was an extraordinary solution, too. The 12 ships were named after various winds and other weather activities—Cyclone (\"Cyclone\"), Ouragan (\"Hurricane\"), and Tornade (\"Tornado\") to name a few.

Three more ships of the series perished during the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942.

"The cruiser which was destined to bear the name of Luigi Amedeo, Duke of Abruzzi, was still on the stocks at the time when a ship named after his elder brother (Emanuele Filiberto Duca d’Aosta) entered service in July 1935. The \"brother\" cruisers—both the younger and the older ones—belonged to the so-called Condottieri class, each being the lead ships in their fifth and fourth series, respectively.\n"

"Duca degli Abruzzi, which joined the Royal Italian Navy at the end of 1937, ranks among the best light cruisers of the pre-war period. Equipped with ten 152 mm guns that were able to fire a shell with an initial velocity of 910 m/s, side armor of 130 mm in total thickness, and a speed of 34 knots, she was, along with her sistership Giuseppe Garibaldi, the most powerful cruiser among Condottieri-class warships. Having sailed through the entirety of World War II and taken part in military operations both for and against the Axis powers, Duca degli Abruzzi continued to serve in the Italian Navy right up until the 1960s."

"Northern Africa was the main theater of operations for the Italian army during the initial period of World War II. The task to supply the masses of troops with everything they needed fell on the shoulders of the Navy. Between the ports of the Apennine Peninsula and Libya, convoys of transport ships went one by one, carrying troops, supplies, equipment, and fuel. Protecting that flow of people and resources was one of the main tasks of the ships of the Regia Marina. \n"
"\n"
"The cruisers of the first two series of Condottieri-class ships were hardly suitable for operating within a squadron due to their poor armor protection. But their speed and weaponry made them irreplaceable when it came to providing cover for military convoys, which often consisted of high-speed liners mobilized for the needs of the war. If troops in Africa urgently needed some sort of cargo, cruisers of the di Giussano and Cadorna classes were there to assist in this being relayed. Such intensive use in the most dangerous of areas entailed a logical outcome: five of the six ships of these two series perished during the first two years of the war."

"Convoys of exceptional importance carrying troops and cargo for the Italian army in Northern Africa were covered by the main forces of the Regia Marina. In some cases, this led to clashes with the British Mediterranean Fleet, which, in turn, were escorting convoys bound for Malta.\n"
"\n"
"On July 9, 1940, a battle took place off the coast of Calabria. It was the first major encounter between British and Italian ships at sea. Ultimately, the opposing fleets parted in a \"draw\", each having completed their main objective: both the convoys, Maltese and Libyan, arrived safely at their destinations. However, the command of the Italian Navy had every reason to draw disappointing conclusions from the clash. Unlike the British, the Italian Navy did not have its own aircraft, and had to request support from the Army Air Force, which was not under their control. It was with great reluctance and belatedly that the Air Force responded to any requests coming from the Navy. As a result, when a wave of British deck torpedo bombers hit the 1st Cruiser Division (comprising Zara and her two sister ships) during the battle, the Regia Marina sailors were forced to rely on the maneuverability of their ships and the strength of their AA defenses."

Montecuccoli's \"Memoires\" emerged as sort of a teaching guide for many commanders of the epochs that followed his own. In choosing the name for the next light cruiser, laid down in 1931, the command of the Royal Italian Navy could not ignore such an outstanding personality. The commemorative badge minted for the ship's servicemen depicts an image of the glorious commander's coat of arms with two-headed imperial eagles, and an anagram of his family name: \"A hundred eyes\" (Latin: \"Centum oculi\"), which became the unofficial motto of the cruiser."

At the turn of the 20th century, more advanced designs appeared, some of which are still being used. These include the anchor patented in 1898 by American engineer, Frederick Baldt. In the early 20th century, it was adopted as the standard anchor for ships of the U.S. Navy. The anchor retains this status, even now at the beginning of the 21st century."

Because of this, Cap's ship received minimal damage—only a fragment from an HE shell smashed a cage in which five polecats resided.\n"

"After the war, the British Navy was scaled down, and Cap received an advanced cruiser named Raleigh. Everything seemed to be just fine, until one day, when Cap was hurrying to reach L'Anse Amour, his ship ran ashore due to dense fog.

Both ships enthusiastically grasped the chance to fill Bismarck with holes and send her to the bottom.\n"

"He would frequently imagine how he would make his way through the wild woods and overcome a bear in hand-to-hand combat. He thought about how he would invent new ways to mend holes in ship hulls with the help of five strobiles and his own brutality. And then he got the perfect chance to reinforce his skills!\n"

Having placed several traps and trip wires across the whole island, Cap took the fight to the aliens. Who was the winner? For sure, you know it!\n"

The assignment for designing a battleship with 305 mm main guns and great number of 76 mm secondary guns was issued in the autumn of 1903. But the construction of the first such ships, South Carolina and Michigan, significantly exceeded the allotted time, and the ships were commissioned only in 1910. Due to the water displacement limit set by Congress, for the first time in the world, four twin-gun main turrets were arranged according to a superfiring scheme in order to save space. That is why South Carolina could fire a broadside from the same number of guns as Dreadnought, which had two extra guns.\n"

"Due to financial limitations, the ship was propelled by steam engines rather than expensive turbines, which made the first American dreadnoughts the slowest-going warships—just 18 knots. This turned out to be their major drawback, one which forced them to cooperate with old-fashioned ironclads.

Four Weymouth-class protected cruisers belonged to the second series of 1911–1912. A drawback of the preceding Bristol class was eliminated on the Weymouth class by arming the ships with artillery of a unified caliber.\n"

The project saw both elements being implemented on a capital ship for the first time ever.\n"

"The next important factor was the unprecedented work tempo at the shipyards in Portsmouth—officially, it took one year to complete the warship. But Dreadnought also had some flaws. The armor protection was sacrificed to achieve greater fire power and speed, so the ship was inferior to the preceding British fleet ironclads. The 76 mm secondary battery guns she carried turned out to be unable to reliably strike modern destroyers.\n"

Derzki combined powerful torpedo and artillery armament with high speed and sea-going qualities.

"Following the naval battles with Japan in the Pacific in 1942, the U.S. Navy ordered a new rapid-firing 203 mm artillery system. A new triple-gun turret with automatic shell loading was designed for this system and, ultimately, a new hull and a new ship had to be designed to carry it.\n"
"\n"
"This is how the Des Moines-class heavy cruisers were created. Almost similar in their appearance, with the exception of size, to their Oregon City-class predecessors, these ships had a staggering main battery firing rate—90 rounds per minute. The ship's set of AA defenses was altered—Des Moines carried single-caliber AA artillery consisting of twelve twin 76 mm automatic guns.\n"

"Only three ships of this class entered service, and one of them—Newport News—became the last artillery cruiser in the U.S. Navy. Having taken part in the hostilities in Vietnam, the ship was decommissioned in 1975."

"The Fletcher-class destroyers were the result of the war that began in Europe and led to the cancellation of all restrictions on the construction of new ships, primarily those on ships' tonnage. Because of this, additional requirements were immediately implemented, for example, to increase the output of the engine and, for the first time, to equip part of the hull with anti-fragmentation armor.\n"
"\n"
"As early as at the design stage, provision was made for an increase in the ship's displacement in order to mount new weapons systems. Initially, the weapons she carried did not differ much from those carried by her predecessors—five 127 mm guns, two 533 mm quintuple-tube torpedo launchers, one additional AA gun, and four additional anti-submarine mortars.\n"
"\n"
"But, when in the course of hostilities, the need arose to dramatically increase the ship's AA and ASW capabilities, this was easily done without compromising stability or other weapons. Therefore, 175 Fletcher-class destroyers that were launched during the war and commissioned in large numbers since the summer of 1942 became the backbone of the U.S. Navy's destroyer forces in the most difficult and decisive battles of World War II."

"After Japan's refusal to join the 1936 London Naval Treaty, the countries that signed it received the right to increase the displacement of their battleships to 45,000 tons. This allowed the U.S. Navy to engage in the design of a long-desired high-speed battleship, which was previously technically impossible due to its limitations. A new 406 mm main battery gun was specifically developed for the ship, and in 1939, Congress approved the construction of four such battleships at once and two more ships soon afterward.\n"
"\n"
"Initially, the project was conceived as a high-speed variant of the South Dakota-class ships, which had already been laid down, but the hull had to be thoroughly redesigned. In terms of armor and anti-torpedo protection, Iowa was almost similar to her predecessor. The new armament meant her main battery guns turned out to be much more powerful. The dual-purpose guns remained the same as those on the South Dakota-class ships. The small-caliber AA artillery was constantly enhanced during service. The main qualitative change was the speed of 32.5 knots in comparison with 27.5 knots.\n"
"\n"
"The long history of the four Iowa-class battleships that were commissioned and survived is fairly well known. But it is remarkable how quickly these ships were built in wartime, despite all the complexity of this work. Three of the four battleships entered service well ahead of schedule. Wisconsin, which was laid down on January 25, 1941, at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, was delivered to the Navy a year and two months ahead of schedule. An amazing result!"

The Project 68-bis cruisers owe their longevity to the excellent characteristics of their 152 mm guns, including when firing at shore-based targets.

"After World War II, Sweden was among the few European countries that had an industry capable of designing and building modern ships of this type. The destroyers were equipped with exclusively Swedish-made machines, mechanisms, combat, radar, and radio systems. Automatic main battery and AA guns with calibers of 120 mm, 57 mm, and 40 mm, and Bofors anti-submarine rocket launchers made Halland almost an exemplary representative of the destroyers of the 1950s. Moreover, during that period, Swedish-made anti-ship missiles were already deployed and tested on the ship. Besides Sweden, only the U.S.S.R. had such weapons at that time.\n"

However, during the Civil War (1861–1865), he proved himself to be a courageous combat officer whose ships frequently found themselves in the heat of battle. The three decades that followed the war were occupied by routine service, then the war that made the future admiral go down in American history began.\n"
"\n"
"At the end of 1897, when the conflict between Spain and the United States was about to turn into direct confrontation, Commodore Dewey was assigned to the Asiatic Squadron. The Commodore hoisted his pennant over USS Olympia, a brand-new protected cruiser. With his usual energy, Dewey spent several months preparing his ships and their crews for combat. On May 1, 1898, the squadron, led by USS Olympia, entered Manila Bay, silenced the shore batteries and, within a period of just several hours, turned the entire Spanish Pacific fleet into burning wreckage—demonstrating the power of modern quick-firing artillery. Without losing a single man, and in just one battle, Dewey ensured victory in the whole theater of operations and became a national hero. The special rank of Admiral of the Navy—the highest rank in the history of the United States—was established just for him in 1903."

After joining the service, he spent 25 years defending the honor of the United States Navy in various shooting competitions. During the 1920 Summer Olympics, Lee earned five gold medals. He managed to combine that path with his service on various ships and in military industry enterprises. When he reached the senior ranks, he was asked to join the Department of the Navy, where he oversaw everything related to fleet training.\n"

"In the first months following the United States' entry into World War II, Lee was an assistant chief of staff to the commander in chief of the U.S. Navy before being sent to the Pacific to command a battleship division. In November 1942, when the Guadalcanal campaign was on the line, it was Willis Lee who tipped the balance in favor of the Americans by destroying Japanese battleship Kirishima. He relied heavily on the radar to achieve this. At the same time, the admiral's flagship—USS Washington—managed to evade detection by the enemy. In the two and a half years that followed, the battleships under Lee's command continued to rain fire down upon enemy positions.

In the U.S.A. this medal was established through orders issued by branches of the Armed Forces. The Navy issued it in June 1919. The Victory Medal was awarded to military personnel for service between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918—the day on which the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany, and the day on which the Armistice of Compiègne between Germany and the Allies was signed accordingly.\n"

The list of ships whose crews had the right to wear one of the clasps on their medals included 1,388 pennants. Thus, the \"GRAND FLEET\" inscription meant that its owner had served from December 9, 1917, through November 11, 1918, on one of the U.S. dreadnoughts that formed part of the British Grand Fleet in the Northern Sea. Ownership of a clasp like this would be demonstrated by a small bronze star worn on the medal's ribbon bar.\n"

However, just like the English Dreadnought was equipped with guns and mounts from the preceding Lord Nelson-class pre-dreadnought battleships, the first American battleships also carried guns and turrets that already had a record of service on the Connecticut- and Mississippi-class pre-dreadnought battleships. Later, that same artillery, virtually unchanged, appeared on the succeeding two pairs of dreadnought battleships of the United States Navy, belonging to the Delaware and Florida classes. At an elevation of 15 degrees, the Mark 5 guns could fire a 394 kg shell approximately 18,300 m, with 100 rounds available for each gun.

All these ships were equipped with 356 mm/45 Mark 1 guns, the first artillery assets with such a caliber in the U.S. Navy. Pennsylvania-class battleships disposed of twelve such guns placed in four turrets. All three guns of each turret were placed in a single slide and had combined elevation aiming. Thanks to the identical turrets, they proved to be interchangeable. For that reason, the main battery guns of Arizona—which have rested at the bottom of Pearl Harbor since December 7, 1941—managed to rain down fire on the enemy that had destroyed her. Three of the guns, those in the fore turret, can still be found on the destroyed battleship. Another of her six guns, along with the aft turrets, were demounted from Arizona during the war and used to create the coastal battery in Hawaii. Three guns of the second turret, which had been damaged by heat from fire on the ship, were restored.

Their super-heavy 1,225 kg Mark 8 AP shells had an effect comparable with the 460 mm ammunition of battleship Yamato, while being considerably lighter. The matter of choosing the main battery for the fast battleships of the U.S. Navy caused a great many discussions in 1938.\n"
"\n"
"On one hand, the 406 mm/45 Mark 6 guns designed in the mid-1930s for the preceding North Carolina and South Dakota-class battleships were already considered to be the most powerful in the world. Compared with other large-caliber guns, they fired very heavy 1,225 kg shells that had a relatively modest initial velocity of 701 meters per second. The shell trajectory was more of an arcing one, and no armored decks of any existing ships were capable of withstanding these shells when fired from significant ranges. Because of this, there were no specific reasons to replace these guns with something new.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, depots in the U.S. stored over one hundred of the 406 mm/50 Mark 2 guns that had been produced throughout 1918–1922 for battleships that went unfinished due to the Washington Treaty on the limitation of naval armament. Owing to a longer barrel length, they possessed very high muzzle energy. This enabled an increase in armor penetration and firing range for the main guns of new ships with small material inputs. Lastly, the Naval Bureau of Ordnance proactively worked on the development of new 406 mm/50 guns that were lighter and more modern. This last factor resolved the issue: according to the estimates, the Mark 2 gun was significantly heavier than the Mark 6 and it required a bigger turret for mounting. This meant an increase in water displacement that would affect the major characteristic of future battleships—their top speed. Having considered all the factors, the General Council of the U.S. Naval Forces decided on the new guns for the main battery."

"Petty officer distinctive insignia and specialty signs in the form of sleeve chevrons were located on the honorable right sleeve of the uniform used by servicemen who operated on the upper deck—the boatswain's crew, gun fire-control system operators, gunner's mates, signal officers, torpedomen, helmsmen, etc. As opposed to the upper-deck officers, their lower-deck crew mates—electricians, gunners, aviators, machinists, storekeepers, etc.—had their chevrons on the left sleeve. However, in accordance with the U.S. Navy Uniform Regulations of 1941, the eagle's head on the petty officer's sleeve chevron must always face forward. Therefore, when we look at the chevron on the left sleeve, the eagle's face is turned to the left, and when we look at the chevron on the right sleeve, the eagle's face is turned to the right.\n"

"The service dress uniform also included a dark-blue sailor cap, but American sailors preferred the much more popular white \"dixie cup\" caps with an upright brim. The name of this cap refers to the name of a manufacturer of white disposable cups that had a similar shape. "

msgid "IDS_PCZC540_USABB_0910_MCCLELLANDBARCLAY4_DESCRIPTION"
msgstr "In cold weather, U.S. Navy sailors and petty officers wore a dark-blue woolen double-breasted short coat with 10 large plastic buttons with anchors. A wide turnover collar and high-positioned slash pockets protected those who wore it from wind and cold—the coat was worn both at sea and on land. The stylish design made this coat popular among civilians and it still remains popular today. The short coat was usually worn with the dress service uniform. Sometimes, especially at sea, sailors put on a sweater under the coat to keep warm. In winter, sailors usually wore a dark-blue woolen sailor cap with a ribbon around the cap band, which had the words \"U.S. NAVY\" printed and shining on its front side in golden letters. It wasn't very popular among sailors who preferred the \"dixie cup\" cap instead and gave it a disrespectful nickname—\"Donald Duck\"—for the resemblance to the cap worn by the cartoon character. However, climate played a key role in choosing headgear, and in Great Britain during the World War II era, the image of an American sailor was inseparable from that of Donald Duck. And of course, this image was complemented by a huge canvas bag with personal belongings. No wonder this bag, along with the winter short coat, have been used to create the iconic image of a \"lone sailor\" embodied in well-known monuments devoted to U.S. Navy sailors."

However, in July 1943, the commander of the 5th Emergency Flotilla of destroyers that operated in the Arctic asked for all of his ships to be painted a bright gray color."

They were distinctive for their seaworthiness and maneuverability, and became the most-used large German combat ships of the end-war period. The average length of service of fleet destroyers was just 13 months. Out of 15 ships that entered service between 1942 and 1944, 11 were destroyed.\n"

"The lead T-22 Flottentorpedoboote joined the Kriegsmarine on February 28, 1942, and soon after that, headed to the Bay of Biscay. She participated in fierce battles against the British forces that attacked German submarines and blockade runners as they entered the Atlantic. In June 1943, Captain Lieutenant Hans Blöse took command of the ship. He spent the entire war on the bridges of destroyers. As commander of T-22, he proved himself in victorious battles in the English Channel. He also managed to survive the German defeat in the Bay of Biscay.\n"

Overnight, on August 18, 1944, T-22 was destroyed by mines in Narva Bay, together with other two Flottentorpedoboote. Hans Blöse himself was luckier—he survived two world wars."

"After failing to build the 37-class destroyers for the Atlantic in 1938, the Kriegsmarine returned to building a ship that would be suited to operating in different theaters. It was decided to develop the previously successful 1936 Roeder-class project. The primary distinction of the new eight 1936A Narvik-class ships was the transition to more powerful 150 mm main battery guns. But the size of \"Narviks\" was too small for this armament and didn't allow for the realization of its benefits, and at the same time, their seaworthiness was sacrificed. In later projects, the Germans returned to installing 127 mm main battery guns on destroyers.\n"
"\n"
"The 1936A-class Z-23 lead ship joined the fleet on September 14, 1940. For her first year and a half of service, the bridge was occupied by Fregattenkapitan Friedrich Böhme (1899–1984), who had previously been commander on destroyer Anton Schmitt and was decorated with the Iron Cross, 1st Class, for the Battle of Narvik. Z-23 always escorted large raiders, including Bismarck, out into the ocean. She also actively operated in the Soviet Arctic and Norway. In May 1942, Böhme was transferred to a command position on land. During 1944 and 1945, he led submarine saboteur units in Normandy and Italy, and earned the Knight's Cross. From the spring of 1943, his former ship participated in battles in the Bay of Biscay until August 12, 1944, when British bombers dealt devastating damage to her in the La Pallice seaport."

Z-35 was ordered again based on the pre-existing Project 1936A. The start of construction was shifted and the ship was laid down only in the middle of 1941. Soon after, based on the operational experience of such destroyers, it was decided to stop using 150 mm main battery guns and bring back the time-tested 127 mm ones. Their AA defenses, as well as their radio and electronic equipment, were also improved. The ship's construction process continued from the middle of 1942, using the reworked 1936B project as the basis. Z-35 was brought into service only on September 22, 1943. She was the first of three destroyers of her class.\n"

Z-35 was his first large ship, and it was also his last. Between February and December 1944, the destroyer operated near the Baltic shores as part of the Kriegsmarine force tasked with preventing the Soviet forces from advancing. At first, the ship was even based in Tallinn—Bätge's hometown. But on December 12, 1944, in an estuary of the Gulf of Finland, the destroyer and the same-class ship Z-36 hit obstacle mines and were destroyed along with their commanders."

Since destroyer Groningen was commissioned in 1956, the province has donated a Christmas tree to the ship's crew every year, and the crew attach this tree to the ship's mast.\n"
"\n"
"This tradition dates back to the 16–17th centuries. On their last voyages to Scandinavia and the Baltic before the shipping routes froze over, Dutch merchant sailboats would tie a fir tree to their masts. This served as a signal to let Dutch folks staying in overseas ports for the winter know that they could leave letters and parcels on board for delivery home. Even when a regular mail service was established, that tradition didn't wane. The people of Groningen cherished the tradition so much that when the same-name destroyer was decommissioned in 1981, they asked the naval authorities to temporarily assign another ship to carry a Christmas tree. That honor was granted to the frigate Kortenaer. When a new patrol ship named Groningen joined the Navy in 2013, she picked up the tradition, and it has been fervently observed ever since."

To congratulate the crews of Royal Netherlands Navy ships at sea, Sinterklaas uses the good old method of transferring fuel, goods, and—should it be necessary—people, between seagoing ships positioned alongside each other. For that purpose, the receiving ship requests data on the speed and bearing of the transferring one (usually a supply vessel) to facilitate a tactful approach alongside it while moving on a parallel course. After that, both ships are connected with lifeline gear. This consists of cable rigging and cargo winches. For fuel transfer, a hose line is used. If crew members are to be moved, the standard practice is to use a rescue basket or, commonly, an ordinary breeches buoy with rubber pants attached."

When aircraft carrier Essex (CV-9) visited the Dutch port of Rotterdam in the Christmas season of 1961, the ship's crew lined up to make the traditional greeting on the flight deck and wished all those on shore a hearty \"Merry Christmas!\" in Dutch, paying tribute to their hospitable hosts.

"Another unofficial tradition bore a link to Christmas celebrations. A specific custom of the military was the Christmas tradition of role reversal. On the day of the festivities, the youngest crew member switched places with the commanding officer for the day. The latter assumed the role of a boatswain and blew the boatswain's pipe as might be necessary. This festive change of roles, which saw a simple seaman take command of an entire ship, raised the crew's spirits and made the day for everyone on board the ship."

However, this was not the case at the end of the first year of World War I, when in the North Sea, the British Navy planned and executed an aerial raid on the German coast. The goal of the attack was the airship hangars at the Cuxhaven base. Cuxhaven, a coastal town in Lower Saxony, was out of range of aircraft based on the British Isles. Therefore, the decision was taken to involve three seaplane tenders, each of which was supposed to launch three aircraft. On December 25, 1914, due to the frosty weather, only seven aircraft were able to start their engines and take off. The outcome of the attack was not a great success, but the raid itself demonstrated the improving operational capabilities of new technology. To cover the seaplane tenders, the entire Grand Fleet was sent to sea—the British seriously expected the German High Seas Fleet to be deployed in response to their air attack. None of the British pilots perished in that operation—three crews returned to the seaplane tenders and were picked up from the water; three more landed near Norderney Island and were picked up by a British submarine. The last pilot landed on water due to an engine malfunction. He was picked up by a Dutch trawler and made his way back home from the Netherlands."

"\n"
"She was the result of naval competition between France and Italy in the period of the 1920s and 1930s—French engineers designed and built the Richelieu-class battleships in response to the Littorio-class battleships that were being laid down in Italian shipyards. The Washington and London Treaties for the limitation of naval armament allowed France and Italy to build capital ships with a total displacement of up to 70,000 tons. Those requirements seriously affected the work of the French and Italian designers, who were forced to comply with the limits. Eventually, France refused to fulfill its obligation to restrict the displacement of the battleship to 35,000 tons—it seemed impossible to build a good modern ship under those conditions. Nevertheless, Richelieu became one of the most innovative and successful treaty battleships in the world."

"After graduating from the Naval Academy, he was sent for an internship in France, where he received additional education and served on cruiser Edgar Quinet, battleship Bretagne, and destroyer Simoun. Later, he visited France again to take part in the transfer of French-built destroyer Burza to Poland. Shortly before the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, Gorazdowski headed for the U.K. as part of the crew of destroyer Błyskawica. During World War II, he was in command of four Polish destroyers.\n"
"\n"
"None of the ships under his command were lost during the war, nor were any of the souls serving on them, even though his ships served extensively in hostilities, particularly off the coast of France in 1945."

msgstr ""
"The lead ship in a series of six large and high-speed destroyers of their class, built for the French Navy in the 1930s. They carried a main battery that consisted of new 139 mm guns with improved shell ballistics and an extended firing range.\n"
"\n"
"After the declaration of war in 1939, all destroyers of this class became part of the raider forces that were tasked with hunting down German blockade runners and raiders. Le Fantasque, along with her two sister ships, was based in Dakar. Their mission was to patrol the waters of the Central Atlantic. By the end of 1939, they had returned to France, and they were transferred to Algeria in April 1940.\n"
"\n"
"After the defeat of France, the ship participated in the Battle of Dakar. Le Fantasque was still in Dakar when French West Africa joined Free France in 1942. The ship underwent an upgrade in the U.S. in 1943 and returned to the Mediterranean to hunt down Axis transport ships. Between raids, Le Fantasque provided fire support for the French landings on Corsica and participated in the liberation of Southern France in 1944."

"Robert Jaujard (1896–1977) was a squadron vice admiral of the French Navy. He joined the Navy when he was 18, in the heat of World War I. He saw combat in the Mediterranean. Jaujard spent the next two decades of his career on various warships, ranging from small dispatch boats to destroyers to battleships, including the newly built Dunkerque. \"Onshore assignments\" were very rare in his career at the time.\n"
"\n"
"Robert Jaujard met the beginning of World War II as commander of destroyer Vauquelin. He spent several months on that ship, guarding Allied convoys in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. In June 1940, at the helm of cruiser Algérie, he took part in attacks on Genoa after Italy had joined the war. In April 1943, when Jaujard was commander of Georges Leygues, a La Galissonnière-class light cruiser, he caught up with and sank a German transport blockade runner in the Central Atlantic. In 1944, Jaujard took charge of a cruiser squadron and made a mark by engaging in the Normandy landings and the liberation of Provence. The highly accurate fire of the French ships and their admiral's composure was admired by the Allied High Command. When the war was over, Robert Jaujard was placed in charge of the French Republic's major naval task force."

Henry Hewitt was repeatedly awarded medals for his inspiring and skillful leadership, as well as his courage and ability to correctly assess the situation at war. He received a second Navy Cross and two \"For Distinguished Service\" medals from both the U.S. Army and the Navy.\n"

In the initial months of the war, she operated in the North Atlantic and took part in the Norwegian campaign. In 1943, the ship underwent modernization in the U.S. that enhanced her air defenses and radio equipment. In June 1944, Montcalm covered the Allied landings in Normandy in the Omaha sector. Later in the war, the cruiser participated in the liberation of Southern France."

Three Soviet-made 130 mm B-2L (Model 1936) twin-gun turrets were supposed to be placed on the ship; however, at the design stage, the B-2L and B-2M projects were merged into one—B-2LM—which caused delays during testing. When she was commissioned into the navy in October 1939, three single-gun 130 mm B-13 gun mounts were placed on the ship as temporary weapons. It was with that artillery on board that the ship met the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. Tashkent received her standard weaponry of three B-2LM mounts by July 1941."

The development of one of them was delayed, mainly due to disputes about weapons. As a result, it was decided to arm the ship with fourteen 305 mm guns in seven turrets, which made her the record holder for the total number of her main battery barrels. Rio de Janeiro was laid down in 1911, but the Brazilian government was forced to sell the ship due to the economic situation. The battleship was acquired by the Ottoman Empire, which planned to put her into operation under the name \"Sultan Osman.\" However, due to the outbreak of World War I, the ship was \"leased\" by the British government and joined the Royal Navy as HMS Agincourt."

Among the presented preliminary projects, the most promising was a variant with 12 main battery guns housed in four triple-gun turrets. In 1910, the first battleship of a new type, Viribus Unitis, was laid down. Entering service in 1912, she became the flagship of the navy and the strongest battleship in the Mediterranean waters. At the very end of the war, on November 1, 1918, Viribus Unitis, already preparing to be transferred to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, was sunk by Italy."

The resulting ship began her operational duty with a skirmish near Vieste in 1915, where Tátra, backed by her sister ship Lika, sank Italian destroyer Turbine. Later, the destroyer participated in the first Battle of Durazzo and in a raid on a dam in Otranto. After World War I, the ship was transferred to the Italian Navy and renamed Fasana."

Kockums, a Swedish shipyard from Malmö, also participated in the competition with its project. The project was based on the Göteborg-class destroyers that had just been laid down and differed from them with a 50% greater displacement and enhanced armament. The prevailing project came from a British firm, resulting in the appearance of the Grom-class destroyers."

The main technical novelty was to be the main battery artillery—it was planned to be dual-purpose and housed in turret mounts. One option was a project with a standard displacement of 1,800 tons. There were plans to build four large destroyers. The design process continued and later culminated in the appearance of the Öland-class destroyers."

In 1941 and 1942, a series of ship projects with 1,750 to 2,500 tons displacements, speeds of 35–38 knots, and main battery armament of 2–3 twin-gun mounts were presented. Öland and Uppland were built according to a compromise project incorporating two of the latest main battery mounts designed for maximum rate of fire. The project turned out to be a success, although a belated one. Over her years of service, the destroyer underwent four upgrades, including the installation of radars and the latest anti-submarine equipment."

In 1929, as Turkey purchased four destroyers from Italy, the first approach prevailed, and Greece ultimately ordered four destroyers to be built with simplified technology, also in Italy. An alternative solution could be the other approach, which envisaged ordering a pair of large ships with 140 mm guns. The most suitable was one of the pre-designs of a fleet cruiser that the British Admiralty was considering at that time. Namely, the E-class cruiser armed with six 140 mm guns. Lambros Katsonis was named after the leader of the national liberation struggle of the Greek people."

The drafts included a project for a cruiser with the MK-6 number, armed with twin mounts housing dual-purpose 130 mm guns.
